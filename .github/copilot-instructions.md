# CMF Volleyball - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
CMF Volleyball project by CMFCollaborative. This file will guide AI coding agents working on this codebase.

## Repository Status
⚠️ **Note**: This repository is currently empty. These instructions serve as a foundation and should be updated as the codebase develops.

## Development Guidelines

### Initial Setup
As the codebase is built, document:
- Primary technology stack and framework choices
- Development environment setup requirements
- Build and test commands

### Code Organization
Document the project structure as it emerges:
- Main application entry points
- Directory structure conventions
- Module/component organization patterns

### Key Workflows
Update with actual commands once established:
- How to run the application locally
- Testing approach and commands
- Deployment procedures

### Project-Specific Conventions
Add conventions as they're established:
- Naming patterns for files, functions, and variables
- Code style preferences beyond linting
- Documentation requirements

### Integration Points
Document as the system grows:
- External services and APIs
- Database schema and ORM usage
- Authentication/authorization patterns
